Employee Registration Program

This program allows users to manage employee ratings by providing functionalities to:
    - Enter new employee rating data.
    - View current employee rating data.
    - Save rating data to a JSON file.
    - Load saved rating data on startup.

The program employs exception handling for file operations and input validation
to maintain data integrity. It uses an interactive menu system for user input
and performs actions based on the selected option.

Features:
    - Register new employee ratings.
    - Display current employee ratings.
    - Save employee ratings to a JSON file.
    - Exit the program.

Constants:
    - MENU: A string constant representing the menu options.
    - FILE_NAME: The file name used to store and load employee data.
    - employees: A list holding dictionaries of employee rating data.
    - menu_choice: A string variable to store the userâ€™s menu selection.

Classes and Modules:
    - IO (from `presentation_classes`): Handles input and output operations.
    - FileProcessor (from `processing_classes`): Handles file operations like reading and writing data.

ChangeLog:
    Khursheed Khan, Dec 7 2024, Updated the script to reflect employee ratings functionality.
    Khursheed Khan, Dec 12 2024, took help from ChatGpt to formalize docustring.
    RRoot, Jan 1 2030, Refactored script for better readability and structure.
